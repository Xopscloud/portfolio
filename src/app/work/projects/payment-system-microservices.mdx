## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive payment system using microservices architecture with Angular frontend and Python backend services. The system is fully containerized with Docker and deployed using Kubernetes with automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular 15+
- **Features**: Real-time payment processing, transaction history, user dashboard
- **Deployment**: Nginx container with optimized build

### Backend Microservices
- **Payment Service**: Python FastAPI for payment processing
- **User Service**: Python Django for user management
- **Notification Service**: Python Flask for alerts and notifications
- **Gateway Service**: API Gateway for routing and authentication

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all services
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes cluster management
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for all microservices
- Integration testing with pytest
- Frontend testing with Jasmine/Karma
- Security scanning with Trivy

### Deployment Strategy
- GitLab CI/CD pipelines
- Blue-green deployment
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Health checks and monitoring

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, RxJS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Django, Flask
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens
