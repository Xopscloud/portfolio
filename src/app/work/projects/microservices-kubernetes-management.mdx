## Project Overview

Designed and implemented a comprehensive microservices management platform using Kubernetes clusters and Helm charts for multiple enterprise applications including payment systems, banking applications, and construction management tools.

## Applications Managed

### Payment System
- **Frontend**: Angular application
- **Backend**: Python microservices
- **Architecture**: Event-driven microservices
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with Helm

### Banking Application
- **Technology**: .NET Core microservices
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps pipelines
- **Database**: SQL Server with Redis caching
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens

### Construction Management App
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with MongoDB
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka

### Laravel Application
- **Framework**: Laravel PHP
- **Databases**: MongoDB and Neo4j
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch

## Kubernetes Implementation

### Cluster Architecture
```yaml
# Kubernetes cluster configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: microservices-prod
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: payment-service
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: payment-api
        image: payment-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Helm Charts Management
